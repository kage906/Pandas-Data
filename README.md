# Introduction
Welcome to the Pandas Challenge! In this project, I analyzed school and standardized test data using Pandas DataFrames. The goal was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to create a report that included various data and metrics, such as district summary, school summary, highest-performing schools, lowest-performing schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type. The data was analyzed to identify trends and patterns in school performance and identify key metrics for future strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities.

# What I Did
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

* Created Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data
* Calculated key metrics such as total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, % passing math and reading, and % overall passing
* Summarized key metrics about each school, including school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, % passing math and reading, and % overall passing
* Identified the highest-performing and lowest-performing schools by % overall passing
* Created DataFrames that listed the average math and reading scores for students of each grade level at each school
* Created a table that broke down school performance based on average spending ranges per student, and identified key metrics such as average math and reading scores, % passing math and reading, and % overall passing
* Created a DataFrame that broke down school performance based on school size and identified key metrics
* Created a DataFrame that showed school performance based on school type and identified key metrics.

# Tools Used
The following tools were used in this project:

* Python - for scripting and data analysis
* Jupyter Notebook - for writing and executing the Python code
* Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
* GitHub - for version control and collaboration
* VSCode - for writing and editing markdown files.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in the following:
* Using Pandas DataFrames for data analysis and manipulation
* Calculating basic statistics and identifying trends in school performance data
* Collaborating on GitHub and using VSCode for writing and editing markdown files.

# Written Report
The data shows that students in charter schools seem to have better performance in academics as far as math and reading scores are concerned in comparison to their counterparts - students in district schools. Charter schools also had higher percentages of students passing math and reading tests. Overall, passing percentages were higher in charter schools. 

If the district schools were trying to assess what they could do better they may want to implement some of the charter schools strategies to try to improve their own. What are their teaching styles, how much study or homework are students given etc. It may also be something thatâ€™s not necessarily implemented in the data such as charters school may have more money or funding, better teachers (longer teaching experience per staff in comparison, higher pay which may boost morale etc), or different student populations. With this information, they may be able to address any key differences.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the Pandas Challenge allowed me to gain hands-on experience in analyzing school and standardized test data using Pandas DataFrames. I was able to calculate various key metrics for district and school-level performance, identify trends and patterns in the data, and create summary reports for different categories. This project also helped me develop my skills in data manipulation, basic statistics, and collaborating on GitHub.
